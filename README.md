# Rock-Paper-Scissors
this is the first Js project in the odin curriculum
this is a game that inputs the player choice as a string,generates a random choice given by the computer and decides who is the winner by doing a bunch of comparisons and calculating the score after 5 rounds
the game happens mainly in the console but the player enters his choice using a prompt.
